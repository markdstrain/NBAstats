This is a project in learning how to scrape data and produce up to date Fantasy League Basketball points
I've used beautiful soup to scrape data from basketball-referenc.com to get my data and I have used python scheduler to keep it up to date.
For right now user's can track their favorite players and keep up with their fantasy league points but eventually I hope to make it so that
users can enter into a fantasy league competition
